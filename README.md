# ANSIColor
AnsiColor for command line in Windows / Linux

Simple C header file for easier use of colored text / background in command prompt. 
Implementation based on ANSI escape codes.

On Windows: If your command prompt does not display colors, you may need to enable 
virtual terminal mode in registry - you can used attached *.reg file.

Best,
